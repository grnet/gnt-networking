# IMPORTANT: Your custom script must configure the network interface FULLY,
# regardless of whether your custom tag, e.g., some-prefix:allow_this, is set.
#
# This is necessary to ensure the interface is in a consistent state when
# local-prefix:allow_this is not defined. Thus you should undo the changes
# which a previous invocation of this script may have done.
#
# In the future, if Ganeti acquires the ability to run ifdown scripts,
# this functionality will be moved there, greatly simplifying the ifup scripts
#
# some-prefix must NOT be synnefo:network: since this is already used by
# synnefo for setting up firewalls, etc.
