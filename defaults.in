# gnt-networking defaults file

# SERVICENAME: Name of the service to use snf-networking for. The software
# expects to find a file with this name under SYSCONFDIR/ganeti/gnt-networking
# to source. This file should implement the functions:
# {pre,post}_setup_{routed,nfdhcpd,ebtables,bridged} if needed by the service.
# SERVICENAME=

# STATE_DIR: Directory to backup the configuration of each interface.
# STATE_DIR=@localstatedir@/lib/gnt-networking

# LOGFILE: File to log gnt-networking related actions
# LOGFILE=/var/log/gnt-networking.log

# IFUP_EXTRA_SCRIPT: Extra script provided by the admin for added/custom
# functionality
# IFUP_EXTRA_SCRIPT=@sysconfdir@/ganeti/ifup-extra

# MAC_MASK: MAC address mask used in private-filtered networks. This is applied
# to the VMs MAC address to get the MAC prefix that guarantees L2 isolation.
# MAC_MASK=ff:ff:f0:00:00:00

# TAP_CONSTANT_MAC: MAC address that all routed TAPs will obtain
# TAP_CONSTANT_MAC=cc:47:52:4e:45:54 # GRNET in hex :-)

# NFDHCPD_STATE_DIR: Directory that hosts the nfdhcpd binding files.
# NFDHCPD_STATE_DIR=@NFDHCPD_STATE_DIR@

# NFDHCPD_STATE_EXTRA: Extra (common) parameters inserted in the nfdhcpd binding files.

# SUPPORTED NETWORK TAGS
# ######################

# BRIDGED_TAG: This Ganeti network tag will cause the instance's TAP interface
# to be bridged to a bridge found through the LINK variable
# BRIDGED_TAG=bridged

# IP_LESS_ROUTED_TAG: This Ganeti network tag indicates the use of a routed
# network setup where the host does not have an IP inside the routed network
# IP_LESS_ROUTED_TAG=ip-less-routed

# MAC_FILTERED_TAG: This Ganeti network tag is used define a MAC-filtered
# network setup. This is used to provide L2 isolation among several VMs through
# the use of ebtables on a single bridge.
# MAC_FILTERED_TAG=private-filtered

# MASQ_TAG: This is not implemented. It's there for future use. Don't use it.
# MASQ_TAG=masq

# NFDHCPD_TAG: This Ganeti network tag is used to indicate the creation of an
# nfdhcpd binding file so that nfhcpd can reply to DHCP, NS, RS and DHCPv6 for
# the instance's network configuration
# NFDHCPD_TAG=nfdhcpd

# DNS_TAG: If this Ganeti tag is found a hook will update and external DDNS
# server to add/remove entries related to the interface that is being managed.
# DNS_TAG=dns

# NS OPTIONS NEEDED BY NSUPDATE
# #############################
#
# To enable this feature the SERVER and FZONE must be defined
# A proper bind configuration is a prerequisite Please see:
# https://wiki.debian.org/DDNS

# SERVER: Name Server IP/FQDN
# SERVER=

# FZONE: DNS zone for the VMs
# FZONE=vm.ganeti.xyz

# TTL: Time to Leave for the DNS entries
# TTL=300

# AUTHENTICATION_METHOD: The authentication method to be used for dynamic DNS
# updates. Valid methods are:
# - plain (nsupdate)
# - bind9 (nsupdate -k KEYFILE)
# - kerberos (KR5BCCNAME=KERBEROS_TICKET nsupdate -g)
# AUTHENTICATION_METHOD=bind9

# KEYFILE: keyfile path to pass to nsupdate with -k option. See man page for
# more info
# KEYFILE=

# Kerberos authentication related settings
# Use them with k5start to obtain a valid ticket:
#   k5start -k KERBEROS_TICKET -u KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL -f KERBEROS_KEYTAB $KERBEROS_KSTART_ARGS
# and then invoke nsupdate with -g option against an AD controller
# KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL=

# Older versions of ebtables cannot handle multiple ebtables processes running
# concurrently. This could lead to failures while setting or cleaning up
# ebtables for VM networks. Later versions support command serialization with
# the --concurrent cmdline option (which uses flock). In order to make sure
# that gnt-networking works as expected with old versions of the software, we
# wrap the command around the runlocked helper which serializes the execution
# of any processes on a host machine by waiting until a successful binding on a
# TCPv4 port on localhost is performed. If you want to further customize the
# locking mechanism, check the input arguments of runlocked.
